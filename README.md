This is my implementation of the frontend test for Sicredi (Dragons).

Created with React.

### available scripts

First install the dependencies by running

####`npm i`

and then, you can run the app with

####`npm start`

and the dev server will be accessible at [localhost:3000/login](http://localhost:3000/login).

To login, you can use the credentials `admin:admin`.

The authentication is made using a simple sessionStorage token, and after logging in, you will be able to access the features.
